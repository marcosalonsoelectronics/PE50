Unstable Behavior of Current-Mode-Controlled DC-DC Converters and its Solution (Part I)

Available at: https://youtu.be/Dz46KUt9dEU

In this video we analyze the unstable behavior of DC-DC converters under current mode control. We demonstrate that the behavior of the converter is unstable when the operation reaches a value of the duty cycle higher than 0.5. This is valid for all converters, namely, buck, boost, and buck-boost converters, and their derivatives. Several LTspice simulations are shown to illustrate the different concepts.
